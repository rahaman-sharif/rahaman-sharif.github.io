Pulse ionization fusion of high purity Cu tape onto Ni sheet to form a CuO/NiO hybrid structure for electrode was possible via picosecond laser. Mainly analysis of morphology with a variation of laser intensity or pulse energy was demonstrated. This method created self-standing, binder-free 3D nanostructures which exhibit remarkable performance as a candidate for the pseudocapacitive electrode.","icon":null,"image":null,"name":"Binder-free NiO/CuO hybrid structure via ULPING (Ultra-short Laser Pulse for In-situ Nanostructure Generation) technique for supercapacitor electrode","status":"live","tags":["Supercapacitors","Material Characterization","Nanomaterials"],"url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-34274-w"},{"description":"Categorized various nano-materials which can be reinforced with Polymer Matrix Composites.
