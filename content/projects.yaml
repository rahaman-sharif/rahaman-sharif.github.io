- name: Binder-free NiO/CuO hybrid structure via ULPING (Ultra-short Laser Pulse for In-situ Nanostructure Generation) technique for supercapacitor electrode
  url: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-34274-w
  description: In this work, the ULPING method was presented to develop a hybrid structure for hybrid structure. Pulse ionization fusion of high purity Cu tape onto Ni sheet to form a CuO/NiO hybrid structure for electrode was possible via picosecond laser. Mainly analysis of morphology with a variation of laser intensity or pulse energy was demonstrated. This method created self-standing, binder-free 3D nanostructures which exhibit remarkable performance as a candidate for the pseudocapacitive electrode.
